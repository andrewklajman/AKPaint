# AKPaint
The purpose of this program is to create a MS Paint Clone.  I would like to include basic features like the following
 * Paint with 
      - Pen
      - Stylish Pen (Straight Line)
      - Marker (Circle)
 * Draw Circle, Rectangle, Line
 * Set Color 
 * Color picker
 * Save / Load image
  
 20180119 - Circle is created... I consider this done!
